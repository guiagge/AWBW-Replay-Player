# AWBW-Replay-Player AWTS Version
An Advance Wars By Web Replay Player modified to have sound and upscaled textures/sprites.
Used to cast the Advance Wars (by Web) Tournament Series (AWTS) games on YouTube: https://bit.ly/3KXy7ou

Still have to rework the audio code (as far as organization goes) so I can contribute to the original project.
To do:
- Add all CO music
- Add sliders to control music and SFX volume (or disable it completely, if the user so chooses)

**Readme is a wip.**
